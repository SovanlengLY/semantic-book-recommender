# Semantic Book Recommender 📚🧠

As a book lover, I found this project really interesting and enjoyable to work on. This small project allowed me to learn how to apply natural language processing and semantic search techniques to build an intelligent book recommendation system. It also serves as my personal assistant when I need to find a new book to read. Of course, it would be better if the dataset were larger and included more books—but it's just a start and a foundation to build upon.

## 🔧 Features

- Semantic search using Sentence Transformers
- Embedding generation and similarity scoring
- Gradio interface for easy interaction
  
## 🚀 My Modifications

While this project builds on the original implementation, I made the following changes to better suit my learning goals and preferences:

- 🔁 Refactored parts of the code for better readability and modularity  
- 🧠 Used a lightweight, open-source embedding model  
- 🔍 Added explanations to improve code understanding
